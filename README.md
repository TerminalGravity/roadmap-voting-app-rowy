## Setup Guide
Full setup instructions video available [here](https://roadmap.vote/setupvideo)

### Step 1: Setup backend template
The backend for the roadmap app is setup on Firebase and managed via Rowy which is a lowcode platform for Firebase. Rowy gives you a Table UI to manage your the data for your roadmap app along with getting all the backend cloud functions for managing the roadmap app setup in one click.   

_Don't worry if you are not familiar with Firebase, Rowy will guide you through the entire process._  

1. Create an account on [Rowy](https://www.rowy.io?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=roadmap) and create a workspace for the Roadmap app
2. Create a new project by connecting it to Firebase - step by step video
3. Create a new table from "Roadmap app" template
4. Now you can manage your appâ€™s data on Rowyâ€™s CMS for Firestore. Add the initial set of data to be displayed on the roadmap app i.e. your productâ€™s features list, their description, target release date, category etc.

###  Step 2: Setup frontend template
Deploy the roadmap appâ€™s frontend to Vercel using the deploy button. Add the following environment variables. Instructions on how to configure them are available on the GitHub repo.

#### One click deploy to Vercel ðŸ‘‡

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frowyio%2Froadmap&env=CLIENT_FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY,SERVER_FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT,SESSION_SECRET,COLLECTION,TABLE_ID&project-name=rowy-roadmap&repository-name=rowy-roadmap)

#### Add the following environment variables to your app on Vercel

- `CLIENT_FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY` â€“ Add your Firebase project's web API key. Get it from your Firebase project [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/settings/general)
- `SERVER_FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` â€“ Generate a Firebase admin sdk service account JSON and add that to your config by following this [link](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) to your Firebase project
- `COLLECTION` â€“ Name of the Firestore collection that stores the roadmap data. Default to `roadmap`
- `TABLE_ID` â€“ Name of the Rowy Table ID. Default to `roadmap`
- `SESSION_SECRET` â€“ `Optional` setup a session secret
- `FEEDBACK_FIN_WEBHOOK_URL` â€“ `Optional` If you want to add a feedback widget to your roadmap app, add the webhook URL setup using [FeedbackFin](https://github.com/rowyio/feedbackfin)

###  Step 3: That's it ðŸŽ‰

Vercel gives you a hosted app domain or [create customized URL](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/domains/add-a-domain). Make sure to add this domain URL to list of [authorized domains](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/authentication/settings) in your Firebase project. Now you are all set to share this URL with your users and start gathering votes/feedback on your product roadmap.
